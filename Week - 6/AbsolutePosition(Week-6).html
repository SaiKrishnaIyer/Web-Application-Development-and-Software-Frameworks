        Apple is the common name for any tree of the genius Malus, of
        the family Rosaceae. Apple trees grow in any of the temperate 
        areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most 
        have stripes or tint of rose. Some apple blossoms are bright 
        red. The wood of the apple trees is fine-grained and hard.
        It is, therefore, good for furniture construction. Apple Trees
        have been grown for many centuries. They are propagated by
        grafting because they do not reproduce themselves.
